  biography: "Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (27 January 1832 â€“ 14 January 1898), better
    known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll, was an English writer, mathematician, logician,
    Anglican deacon and photographer. \n\nHis most famous writings are Alice's Adventures
    in Wonderland, its sequel Through the Looking-Glass, which includes the poem Jabberwocky,
    and the poem The Hunting of the Snark, all examples of the genre of literary nonsense.
    \n\nHe is noted for his facility at word play, logic, and fantasy. There are societies
    in many parts of the world (including the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States,
    and New Zealand[3]) dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of his works and
    the investigation of his life. In 1982, his great-nephew unveiled his memorial
    stone in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey."
